<p class="col-sm-12 px-5">
    I rushed a little to release this plugin so I could understand more the needs of the community through feedback.
    I'm also expecting ideas and suggestions so I can improve it.<br />
    Also, better code standards: The code is open on github.
    If you spot some bad code, or something that could be done in a better way, please, do enlighten me. I'm always
    eager to improve.
    <br /><br />
    Here are the improvements and new functionalities I'm planning for the near future:
    <br /><br />

<h5 class="col-sm-12 px-5">Improvements:</h5>
<div class="col-sm-12 px-3">
    <p class="col-sm-12 px-5"><b>A better background</b> - I now it's hard to read those FStrings and Bools.
        I'm following the color code from blueprint variables.
        For now, use the mouse to hover, or click on the line; the background changes with hovering and selection,
        making it easier read.<br />
        (the dark background of UE5 makes it so much better)
        <br /><br />

<h5 class="col-sm-12 px-5 d-flex">New functionalities:</h5>
<div class="col-sm-12 px-3">
    <p class="col-sm-12 px-5"><b>Dumping objects</b> - Well, C++ doesn't have reflection, so there is no way to dump
        everything like the "vardump" from php
        (yes, that's where I got the inspiration for this). So I'm thinking of a way of storing the references, as
        pointers,
        of a object dump properties so then could be updated easily.<br />
        Something like VARDUMP(Object, objParameter1, objParameter2, DumpAddressOfSubObject1,
        DumpAddressOfSubObject2)<br />
        Then calling UPDATEDUMP(Object) to update all the tree.<br />
        I hope this is possible. But if I manage to manipulate the pointers, then it leads to the next new
        functionality:
        <br /><br />
        <b>Updating by reference and VARWATCH</b> - Having pointers of the dumped variables, then there is no more
        need to update using the name,
        making it easier to update from various instances of a object. I already made this work, just have to solve
        this for arrays.
        The consequence of this, is the ability to make a VARWATCH macro that updates the values without the
        necessity to call UPDATEDUMP.

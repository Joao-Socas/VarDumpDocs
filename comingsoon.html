    I rushed a little to release this plugin so I could understand more the needs of the community through feedback.
    I'm also expecting ideas and suggestions so I can improve it.<br />
    Also, better code standards: The code is open on github.
    If you spot some bad code, or something that could be done in a better way, please, do enlighten me. I'm always
    eager to improve.
    <br /><br />
    Here are the improvements and new functionalities I'm planning for the near future:
    <br /><br />

<h5 class="col-sm-12 px-5 d-flex">New functionalities:</h5>
<div class="col-sm-12 px-3">
    <p class="col-sm-12 px-5">
        <b>Extend the functionalities to blueprints</b> - As suggested on the plugin questions page on Epic Store,
        I'll extend the functionalities for blueprints. I think this will greatly improve the number of people using the plugin.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Value History</b> - I intend to generate a value history, so every time you update a dump, the old values will be stored,
        becoming possible to see all the values assumed by a variable.
        <br /><br />
        <b>VARWATCH</b> - The VARWATCH macro will be a new macro that updates itself without the need to call the UPDATEDUMP
        or UPDATEOBJECTDUMP. Won't generate a history though.
